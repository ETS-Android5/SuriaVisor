The SURIA Video Surveillance system, developed at the GEYSED Center from the University of Computer Sciences, allows the visual monitoring of the cameras of a security system simultaneously. Likewise, it makes possible to record the video streams from the cameras, allowing to have evidence of what happened and also to retrieve and analyze the recordings made. However, the work of users of this system is limited because they can only monitor the cameras from a room through desktop computers running the system. These are the circumstances that require the existance of this work, which focuses of the research and development of an application that allows the visualization of cameras for the SURIA 3.0 system on devices running Android Operating System. With the development of the aforementioned mobile application, a solution that complements and facilitates the work of the users of the video surveillance system is provided, offering greater mobility without being deprived of the visualization of the images transmitted by the cameras.
